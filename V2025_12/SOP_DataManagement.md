# Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define a data management system which ensures data security, as well as enables data sharing and version control in an efficient and secure way. 

# Scope
This document lays out the general principles of data management, as well as the top-level folder architecture. Detailed folder structures related to consulting and modeling activities, as well as business related activities are described in separate documents. 

# Definitions
For definition of terms, see Quality Manual document, Section “Terms & Definitions”. 

# Responsabilities
Every collaborator is responsible for implementing the present data management system.

# Tools and Equipment
Google drives, as part of Google Apps for Work, is used as supporting software to implement the data management system. Instructions for installing google drive can be found in the inventory QMS for supporting software.

# Procedure
All documents should be saved on the google drive. This ensures data security and puts into place a back-up, version control and sharing system with permission control for data access. The top-level directory structure is the following:
* LYO-X
  * [customer-project name] (for all consulting and modeling activities on a given project)
  * 1_LYO-X-CRM
  * 1_LYO-X-F-FINANCES
  * 1_LYO-X-HR-MGMT
  * 1_LYO-X-OFFICE
  * LYO-X-MARKETING
  * LYO-X-ADMIN-[employee first name and last name] (for administrative purposes such as personal data or salary certificates, etc.)
  * LYO-X-EXCHANGE (for exchanging files among LYO-X associates)
  * LYO-X-HR-ASSOCIATES
  * LYO-X-PROJECT-MANAGEMENT
  * LYO-X-QMS 2023 (for all QMS documents: SOPs, inventories, lists,...)
  * LYO-X-TEST-MODEL (for implemented literature models)
  * LYO-X-UTILITIES (for internal toolbox, literature and other general matter)

The principle for documents sharing between collaborators is to share folders only on an as needed basis. According to the data security and confidentiality SOP, access to information should be limited so that only associates needing data to be able to deliver their client work, are given access to sensitive information. 

The Managing Director has the full access rights and administrative rights to the document system. He also assigns access rights to the document system components on a need basis.
